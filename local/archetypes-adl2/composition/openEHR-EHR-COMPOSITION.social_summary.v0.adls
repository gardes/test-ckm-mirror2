    This archetype has been designed primarily to hold the EVALUATION.social_summary archetype as the framework to contain nested, detailed CLUSTER archetypes, each of which will describe the various aspects of the specific social circumstances or experiences in detail.
    
    The scope of Social summary record/document can include, but is not limited to:
    - an overview;
    - household details;
    - housing details;
    - education and training details;
    - occupation details; and
    - domestic/family violence information.
    
    The intent of this COMPOSITION is for use as a persistent summary, however it has been identified that for implementation the archetype also needs additional attributes related to the context of the event. As a result, the COMPOSITION has been temporarily modified as an EVENT COMPOSITION which allows addition of an Items SLOT into which additional context-related archetypes can be included. This new requirement for context-related attributes in the Persistent COMPOSITION has been requested as a future openEHR Reference Model update.
    
    Initial design of this archetype was funded by the Hearing Health project, Northern Territory, Australia.">
