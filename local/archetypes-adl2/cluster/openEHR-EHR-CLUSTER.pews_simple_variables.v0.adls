    As there are many variations for the values for the 3 main component parameters that may depend on the model used and age of the child, this archetype has been designed to provide a neutral framework for each parameter. This framework can be used:
    - within a template, with the value for each ordinal added directly to the template; 
    - as the generic parent archetype that could be specialised to represent a specific approach and age; or
    - as the framework for a clinical system which populates template parameters at run-time.">
